# Migration from Prisma to Supabase

This application has been migrated from using a hybrid approach (Supabase Auth + Prisma ORM) to using Supabase fully for both authentication and database operations.

## Changes Made

1. Removed Prisma dependencies
   - Removed `@prisma/client` and `prisma` from package.json
   - Replaced the Prisma schema with Supabase SQL migrations

2. Updated Database Schema
   - Created equivalent tables in Supabase
   - Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Updated field names to follow Supabase conventions (snake_case)

3. Updated API Routes
   - Modified all API routes to use Supabase queries instead of Prisma
   - Ensured consistent data format between API responses

4. Updated Types
   - Changed type definitions to match Supabase schema format
   - Updated field names to match snake_case convention

## How to Complete the Migration

If you have existing data in a Prisma database that you need to migrate to Supabase:

1. Export your data from your existing PostgreSQL database (used by Prisma)
2. Format it according to the new schema (see `supabase_schema.sql`)
3. Import the data into your Supabase tables

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single provider for auth and database
2. **Row Level Security**: Built-in data security at the database level
3. **Realtime Subscriptions**: Ability to use Supabase's realtime features
4. **Edge Functions**: Can use Supabase Edge Functions for serverless features
5. **Storage Integration**: Easier integration with Supabase Storage

## Cleaning Up

You can safely delete the following files/directories:
- `prisma/` directory 
- Any `prisma.generate` scripts in package.json
- Any direct imports of `@prisma/client`
